The slightest\ncarelessness can cause painful traumas or falls. For this reason, for some specific items we developed a special\nanti torsion shank to give the best stability to the shoe on every ground. However for us stability should not be\nrigidity. Consequently we decided to use a specific thermoplastic material to assure the natural foot movement\nat every step. Particularly suitable for the building sector, where the risks caused by uneven and wet grounds are\nhigher, this anti torsion technology is also suitable for people working on ladders (painters, windows’ cleaning,\nbricklayers) by increasing stability in the central zone of the plant, the mostly standed area on the ladder. This insert\nlimits the heel stress and helps plant arch and ankle.\nCLICK Open system\nA correct shoe lacing is a very important aspect improving comfort, thanks to a better fit, and increasing safety,\nthanks to the impossible unfastening with consequent falling risk. The Click Open system, thanks to the inox steel\nyarn covering all the instep of the shoe and to the memory mechanism, guarantees a safe and uniform lacing, avoiding that the foot rubs with the upper. This technology is particularly suggested for people working with gloves. In\nfact, by using the simple knob, this lacing system allows to quickly wear and remove the shoe, simply rotating one\nof the two directions.\nIt is a light stretch heat regulating membrane which blocks wind and water and maintains unaltered\nthe microclimate between the skin and the fabric. It is a vanguard product due to its light weight and in particular of its elasticity. During working time, also in winter, the foot temperature tends to increase together with heat production. In order to contain the temperature, the heat is dispersed through perspiration. The perspiring level of Windtex®, together with windproof property, keep the microclimate of the footwear. Besides, the membrane utilizes the innovative Aegis® antimicrobial technology, an antimicrobial treatment that detaches and breaks the cell membrane of microorganisms by inhibiting the life processes of bacteria. It is a patented method that works through a physical and ion phenomenon. The antibacterial treatment is permanent and protects against unpleasant odors, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms through an antimicrobial barrier.\n\nWINTHERM® SAFETY guarantees the insulation from cold using two technologies combined together.\nINSULATION:\nthe thin fibres of the felt keep the air inside the shoe guaranteeing the insulation from cold environment thanks\nto the physical properties of the string, which is a poor conductor of heat but a very good insulating material.\nREFLECTANCE: the presence of a microfilm of aluminium inside the felt enables to maintain its reflective\nproperties: the heat generated by the foot is preserved inside the shoe. The union of these two technologies enables to obtain a very high level of thermic insulation with a low thickness of the felt and a subsequent reduction of the bulk inside the shoe.\nWintherm® antibacterial guarantees a very good transpiration and meets fully the requirements of permeability and water vapor coefficient foreseen by the regulation UNI EN ISO 20345\n\nMicrowash is an extremely perspiring material, suitable for alimentary and hospitals’ sectors, studied to assure the maximum comfort to people who, during a lot of hours, wear the shoe on a very wet surface. The finishing of the material with perspiring polyurethanes, giving the aspect of the full grain leather, guarantees the complete foot perspiration and the complete resistance to acids, like the oleic acid. About weight, microfiber is 40% lighter than the natural leather. This material is washable at 40° with\nwater and neutral soap. Please pay attention: the shoe can’t be washed in the washing machine. The fabric, with its microfiber base, is Chrome free.\n\nAirnet® is a patented technology suitable for people who want to have the maximum perspiration on the working place, without giving up the safety of a strong and abrasion resistant shoe. This technology, thanks to its construction air tunnel, facilitates the air passage and the material, 100% polyester guarantees a perfect resistance to abrasion, to traction, to tearing and to washing. Airnet® is a certified technology. It passes the tests as per the norm EN ISO 20345:2011 5.5.2 (6.12) for the abrasion resistance: > 51.200 cycles dry and > 25.600 cycles wet.\n\nIdrotech® is a registered brand concerning a leather treatment with the aim to optimize the water resistance and the foot perspiring. In this way it assures the maximum comfort in every season and the maximum protection from the external agents. Furthermore, this particular tanning method, thanks to the used mineral salts, gives an excellent softness and a complete mechanical resistance to oils and to hydrocarbons.\nThe IDROTECH® leather is certified according to the norms ISO 4045, ISO 17075 and ISO 5403.\n\nThe Zero Abrasion technology is the ideal solution for people who need more protection against wear and abrasion.\nThe anti-scratch leather, finished with a polyurethane multi-layer, assures a complete protection of the upper from cuts and abrasions that continuously damage and wear the shoe. It is the reply for people who, also after several months from the first usage, want to wear perfect and highly performing shoes. At the same time, this leather contains a technology that guarantees a high water and oil resistance level.\n\nDGUV112-191 (ex BGR 191)\nGerman Regulation of safety shoes concerning orthopedic shoes meeting the requirements of the norm EN ISO 20345: 2011.\nIn Europe it is spreading the use of orthopedic insoles in safety footwear providing people with foot problems more stable conditions, proper posture and a benefit to the whole body.\nMander-Malms Gmbh is a German company specialized in the production of custom orthopedic insoles suitable for Giasco footwear.\n\nSTABILITY SUPPORT\nThe Stability Support device is the technology developed by Giasco, aiming to guarantee the maximum heel support during walking.\nThis special support, if compared with the standard ones on the market, is its internal structure localizing the support only on specific heel zones, avoiding an excessive stress and guaranteeing the maximum well-being for the feet. Its action helps a correct walking and a better weight discharge on the whole feet with advantages for the body, particularly for the back and for the joints. Finally this support allows a better foot fitting, by decreasing the internal rubbing of the heel with the upper and consequently decreasing the usury of the shoe."
